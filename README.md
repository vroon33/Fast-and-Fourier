## Problem Statements:
1. Bird Recognition
    - Given a set of bird sounds, classifying them into three different species, given the reference files.
    - Related: SPCC, Cross-Correlation, Spectrograms

2. Heart Rate Estimation
   - Given a noiseless ECG signal, estimating average heart rate.
   - Use the same detection algorithm with noise filters on noisy ECG signals
   - Related: R-R peak detection, PanTompkins algorithm. 

4. Loudness Segmentation
   - Detection of Loud words in a human spoken audio file.
